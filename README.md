# DevFolio
DevFolio — a modern open-source platform that showcases a curated collection of developer portfolios. Each portfolio card displays the creator’s GitHub repo, live website, and tech stack — all beautifully organized in a sleek, responsive UI. Anyone can easily contribute their own portfolio via GitHub, and once merged.
